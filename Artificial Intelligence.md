# Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence, this word has been a highlight of the engineering field for decades. And why it not be? Who would not appreciate having a *J.A.R.V.I.S* at his command, always ready to help its master? Movies have always portrayed AI with certain personifications and limitless future possibilities.   

Nevertheless, that's not just what AI is and it's certainly not a recent achievement. For ages, humans have been trying to mimic their natural intelligence in their works. Intelligence is not any trait of human behavior rather it is the combination of many diverse abilities. Artificial Intelligence mainly focuses on a few traits of intelligence - learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and using language. In layman's terms, any machine or piece of code which can show (or mimic) the above traits of intelligence is AI-integrated.  

## Where did it come from?

The very first machine later became the base model for the study of AI is "Alan Turing Machine". The British computer pioneer Alan Mathison Turing, in 1935, theorized a computer model which will follow a set of instructions and scan what's written in its memory, symbol by symbol, thereafter writing more symbols on its own. Turing's conception now known as the universal Turing machine was put into test during World War II.   
In 1945, British Government was in dire need of someone that could break the secret communication code of opponents. Alan Turing being a leading cryptanalyst was assigned the job but deciphering unknown combinations of symbols required thousands and ten thousands of permutation-combinations. This tedious task was certainly beyond human patience, also any error could cost the ongoing war. Turing was then reminded of his own theoretical model that could learn from past experiences as well as solve new problems having given certain heuristic guidelines. They witnessed the birth of the first AI machine amidst the war -  a code-deciphering weapon. This incident revolutionalized the research on Artificial Intelligence.

In 1956, Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy organized a meeting with some leading scientists of their time to discuss the training and usage of intelligence given to any machine. The term "Artificial Intelligence" was given to the field by John McCarthy. this conference, *the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956*,  was the moment that gave AI its name and its mission.

## Training of AI

AI learns by several different methods. The simplest one is "rote learning". In 'rote-learning', the program performs trial and error until it reaches the correct solution for the problem and saves the solution in its memory. The next time the same problem appears, it simply applies the solution saved earlier. This approach of learning fails in generalization.
For example, if a similar but not the same problem is given to the program, it won't deduce any similarity and thus won't apply the previous solution. It will just simply start from scratch. However, if the same program is trained to deduce patterns and similarities, it will apply previously saved solutions with required modification.

The first approach *"rote learning"* is called **the Symbolic** (or "top-down") approach and the second approach is the Connectionist ("bottom-up") approach. The Symbolic approach seeks to replicate intelligence by analyzing cognition and pattern against a defined set of instructions fed into the program. On the other hand, **the Connectionist** approach mimics intelligence by actually creating an artificial neural network - an imitation of the actual brain's structure.

Symbolic techniques are quite well in simplified constrained realms but break down in real-world scenarios. As for the Connectionist approach, it handles complex problems a little well than the previous one but researchers have been unable to replicate the neurons of even the fully known simplest worm.

## Goals of AI
Using the methods outlined above, AI attempts to achieve one of the three goals : 

*Cognitive simulation -* Cognitive simulation is used to test theories and models on how the human brain works. Like how the human brain recalls something from memories or how it recognizes faces and voices. This simulation technology is already being used in neuroscience and cognitive psychology as a very powerful tool for understanding and visualization. 


*Applied AI -* It is also known as advanced information processing. It is the branch of AI that deals with real-world problems. It aims to build devices "smart" enough to interact with a real-life scenario and solve problems by processing pieces of information fed to the system. For example, this AI is used in medical diagnosis systems and stock-trading systems where it processes previous data and deduces further results respective to the current input.

*This information processing AI is now-a-day used as a part of our favorite voice assistance - Siri, Alexa, Google assistance, etc, as Conversational AI.* ***Conversational AI*** *uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand human language and interact in the same way.* 

**Strong AI -** Strong AI aspires to build machines that think like real humans. A machine whose intellect is indistinguishable from that of a human being. No matter how fascinating this concept may be, till now very little progress has been accounted for in this field. Some researchers also think that it is not possible or even worthless to build Strong AI.

Perhaps, building an AI that thinks like a human may result in catastrophe or revolution. Whatever may the consequences be, building a *ULTRON* or *VISION* would definitely require a mind stone (i.e. complete micro-mapping of the human brain into circuits).
